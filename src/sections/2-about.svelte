	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		I'm Dan, a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Since 2019, I have worked
		on a variety of personal and academic projects, including websites, applications, games, and
		robots. These projects have helped me learn and gain experience with a wide range of
		technologies, tools, and programming languages. They also sparked my passion for software
		development which ultimately inspired me to choose Software Engineering as my major.
	</p>
	<p>
		I thrive on learning new things and tackling challenging problems. In fact, my friends and I
		frequently participate in hackathons, where we create ambitious projects in a short amount of
		time, using unfamiliar tools and technologies. I believe hackathons are the best way to gain new
		skills and hear from experts in the field. Additionally, during my time at Vanier College, I was
		a member of the Vanier Robotics Team, where we built robots to compete in the CRC Robotics
		Competition. My role involved designing and manufacturing plastic robot parts using a 3D
		printer. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork and communication in a fast-paced
		environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lastly, I love to teach and share my knowledge with others. While at Vanier College, I
		volunteered 105 hours teaching science to a class of 20 fifth-grade students in French. I
		simplified complex scientific concepts to inspire curiosity and led hands-on science experiments
		to foster collaboration, engagement, and a deeper understanding of scientific principles.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I'm currently seeking a co-op
		position for Summer 2025. Let's connect!
